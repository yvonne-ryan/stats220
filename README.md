# stats220
**Hello and welcome to my STATS 220 repository!** 

You'll find that this repository is dedicated to my first STATS 220 Assignment based around creating `html` using modern technologies! So if you've stubbled upon this and would like to check it out, here's the [link!](https://yvonne-ryan.github.io/stats220/)

While I created this for a Statistics course, you'll notice that I've themed my assignment around a small lawn-mowing and garden maintenance business I help to run.

     <em>Hopefully one day I'll know enough to create our own website!</em>

#### If you're still here, here's a little about me and why I'm here! 

I've been a student at the University of Auckland for quite some time now - *far too long* - studying my way through a Bachelor of Commerce and Science Conjoint!
The more I get through my degree, the more fascinated I am with manipulating and visualising data, making it readable and :sparkles: pretty :sparkles:

Here are three of my main goals I hope to achieve from this degree and course:

1. To be able to manipulate all kinds of data into more readable formatting 
    - *there's something so satisying about turning screens of numbers into beautiful and readable graphs* 
    - *my fav at the moment are time series analyses of financial data!* 
2. To learn a coding language - even just to an intermediate level
    - *why pay someone else to code something for you if you can learn to do it yourself?!*
3. Learn the skills to be able to keep up with this forever advancing technological world!
    - *not just to keep up with it, but to help others keep up with it too!*

So there you have a little about me! Thanks for reading!
