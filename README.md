# stats220

Edit the README.md file so that it contains a link to the website for your stats220 repo.
https://yvonne-ryan.github.io/stats220/

Your README.md file should also contain some information about the purpose of the repo, so that other people who view your repo on GitHub know why you made it.
Upload your meme image file (e.g. my_meme.png) from your computer into your stats220 repo.

Create a new file within your stats220 repo called “index.md”.

Edit the index.md file so that it displays a new original meme that you have created using Rcode and the {magick} package, as well as the R code you used to create it.

Your index.md file needs contain information about the meme you created, for example, whatthe motivation was, and how your meme is new/original (e.g. an adaption of an existing memeformat).

Either one or both of your README.md and index.md files needs text that demonstrates at least the following Markdown syntax:
* use of two different levels of headers
* use of two different types of bullet points (ordered or unordered)
* use of bold and italics
* use of links to other websites
* use of images, including those within your repository and those accessed from other websites
* use of code fences
